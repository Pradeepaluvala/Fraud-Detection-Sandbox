# Fraud Detection Sandbox Environment

This project simulates a sandbox environment for testing fraud detection using synthetic transaction data. It includes data generation, analysis, and a basic model for detecting fraudulent transactions.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains synthetic transaction data.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and visualization.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data generation and model training.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Usage
1. Generate synthetic data with `scripts/generate_synthetic_data.py`.
2. Analyze data with `notebooks/data_analysis.ipynb`.
3. Train and test the fraud detection model with `scripts/fraud_detection_model.py`.
